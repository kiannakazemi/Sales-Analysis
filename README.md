# Sales-Analysis
Answer to the top business questions

In this project I used different python libraries to analyze and answer business questions about 12
months worth of sales data.

Once I cleaned the data -drop NaN values, remove rows based on a condition, change the type of some columns, I started exploring 6 high level business questions related to the data:

    - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    
    - Which city had the highest number of sales?
    
    - When is the best time to display advertisements to maximize likelihood of costumers buying product?
    
    - What products are most often sold together? 
    
    - What products sold the most?
    
    - Predict the next year sales.
